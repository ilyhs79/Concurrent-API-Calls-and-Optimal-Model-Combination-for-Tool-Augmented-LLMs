The takeoff speed of a military aircraft from an aircraft carrier is approximately 170 mi/hr relative to the air. They acquire this speed through a combination of a catapult system present on the aircraft carrier and the aircraft's jet propulsion system. A common strategy is to head the carrier and the plane into the wind. If a plane is taking off from an aircraft carrier which is moving at 55 mi/hr into a 30 mi/hr headwind, then what speed relative to the deck of the aircraft carrier must it obtain to takeoff?

While training for breeding season, a 365 gram male squirrel does 32 pushups in a minute, displacing its center of mass by a distance of 8 cm for each pushup. Determine the total work done on the squirrel while moving upward (32 times).
Work = Force x Distance
Force = mass x acceleration due to gravity
Force = 0.365 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 3.577 N
Distance = 8 cm = 0.08 m
Work = 3.577 N x 0.08 m x 32 = 9157.12 J

The total work done on the squirrel while moving upward (32 times) is 9157.12 joules.

Cassie has just finished her session on the trampoline during PE. As she prepares to exit the trampoline, her vertical momentum is reduced by a series of three resistive impulses with the bounce mat. Just prior to this series of impulses, her 51.5-kg body is moving downward at 8.50 m/s. On the first impulse, Cassie experiences an average upward force of 235 N for 0.72 seconds. The second impulse of 76 N*s lasts for 0.48 seconds. The last impulse involves an average upward force of 116 N which cases a 92 kg*m/s momentum change. What vertical velocity does Cassie have after these three impulses?
