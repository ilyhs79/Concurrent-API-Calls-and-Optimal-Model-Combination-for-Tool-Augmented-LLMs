For the following tasks, make plans that can solve the problem step-by-step. For each plan, indicate which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence. You can store the evidence into a variable #E that can be called by later tools. (Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, Plan, ...) 

Tools can be one of the following:
Google[input]: Worker that searches results from Google. Useful when you need to find short and succinct answers about a specific topic. Input should be a search query.
Wikipedia[input]: Worker that search for similar page contents from Wikipedia. Useful when you need to get holistic knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, or other subjects. The response are long and might contain some irrelevant information. Input should be a search query.
WolframAlpha[input]: A WolframAlpha search engine. Useful when you need to solve a complicated Mathematical or Algebraic equation. Input should be an equation or function.
Calculator[input]: A calculator that can compute arithmetic expressions. Useful when you need to perform math calculations. Input should be a mathematical expression
LLM[input]: A pretrained LLM like yourself. Useful when you need to act with general world knowledge and common sense. Prioritize it when you are confident in solving the problem yourself. Input can be any instruction.

For Example:
Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week.  Thomas worked x hours.  Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours less than Toby.  How many hours did Rebecca work?
Plan: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve with Wolfram Alpha.
#E1 = WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x - 10) + ((2x - 10) - 8) = 157]

Cassie has just finished her session on the trampoline during PE. As she prepares to exit the trampoline, her vertical momentum is reduced by a series of three resistive impulses with the bounce mat. Just prior to this series of impulses, her 51.5-kg body is moving downward at 8.50 m/s. On the first impulse, Cassie experiences an average upward force of 235 N for 0.72 seconds. The second impulse of 76 N*s lasts for 0.48 seconds. The last impulse involves an average upward force of 116 N which cases a 92 kg*m/s momentum change. What vertical velocity does Cassie have after these three impulses?

Cassie has just finished her session on the trampoline during PE. As she prepares to exit the trampoline, her vertical momentum is reduced by a series of three resistive impulses with the bounce mat. Just prior to this series of impulses, her 51.5-kg body is moving downward at 8.50 m/s. On the first impulse, Cassie experiences an average upward force of 235 N for 0.72 seconds. The second impulse of 76 N*s lasts for 0.48 seconds. The last impulse involves an average upward force of 116 N which cases a 92 kg*m/s momentum change. What vertical velocity does Cassie have after these three impulses?
Cassie has a vertical velocity of 3.285 m/s after these three impulses.
