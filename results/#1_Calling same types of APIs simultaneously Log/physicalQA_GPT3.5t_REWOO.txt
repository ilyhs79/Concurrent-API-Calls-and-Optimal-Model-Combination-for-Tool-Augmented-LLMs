A California Condor is approaching its nest with a large chunk of carrion in its beak. As it approaches, it makes an upward swoop, achieving a momentary upward velocity of 9.4 m/s when the carrion falls from its mouth, hitting a cliff outcropping 45.4 m below.

The rescue basket is lowered to the roof and some occupants of the top floor escape to the roof and enter the basket.

Google[input]: Worker that searches results from Google. Useful when you need to find short and succinct answers about a specific topic. Input should be a search query.
Wikipedia[input]: Worker that search for similar page contents from Wikipedia. Useful when you need to get holistic knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, or other subjects. The response are long and might contain some irrelevant information. Input should be a search query.
WolframAlpha[input]: A WolframAlpha search engine. Useful when you need to solve a complicated Mathematical or Algebraic equation. Input should be an equation or function.
Calculator[input]: A calculator that can compute arithmetic expressions. Useful when you need to perform math calculations. Input should be a mathematical expression
LLM[input]: A pretrained LLM like yourself. Useful when you need to act with general world knowledge and common sense. Prioritize it when you are confident in solving the problem yourself. Input can be any instruction.

For the following tasks, make plans that can solve the problem step-by-step. For each plan, indicate which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence. You can store the evidence into a variable #E that can be called by later tools. (Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, Plan, ...) 

Tools can be one of the following:
Google[input]: Worker that searches results from Google. Useful when you need to find short and succinct answers about a specific topic. Input should be a search query.
Wikipedia[input]: Worker that search for similar page contents from Wikipedia. Useful when you need to get holistic knowledge about people, places, companies, historical events, or other subjects. The response are long and might contain some irrelevant information. Input should be a search query.
WolframAlpha[input]: A WolframAlpha search engine. Useful when you need to solve a complicated Mathematical or Algebraic equation. Input should be an equation or function.
Calculator[input]: A calculator that can compute arithmetic expressions. Useful when you need to perform math calculations. Input should be a mathematical expression
LLM[input]: A pretrained LLM like yourself. Useful when you need to act with general world knowledge and common sense. Prioritize it when you are confident in solving the problem yourself. Input can be any instruction.

For Example:
Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week.  Thomas worked x hours.  Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours less than Toby.  How many hours did Rebecca work?
Plan: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve with Wolfram Alpha.
#E1 = WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x - 10) + ((2x - 10) - 8) = 157]
Plan: Find out the number of hours Thomas worked.
#E2 = LLM[What is x, given #E1]
Plan: Find out the number of hours Rebecca worked.
#E3 = Calculator[(2 * #E2 - 10) - 8]

Begin! Describe your plans with rich details. Each Plan should be followed by only one #E.

Lon Mauer is cleaning up the driveway after mowing the grass. He exerts a sudden downward force of 71 N at a constant angle of 54.7° below the horizontal in order to accelerate his 0.8-kg broom from rest. The coefficient of friction between the broom bristles and the driveway is 0.59. Determine the rate of acceleration of the broom.
Plan: Use the given force and angle to calculate the horizontal and vertical components of the force using trigonometric functions, then use the mass of the broom and the coefficient of friction to calculate the net force and finally use Newton's second law to calculate the acceleration.

#E1 = Calculator[71 * cos(54.7°)] 
#E2 = Calculator[71 * sin(54.7°)]
#E3 = Calculator[0.8 * 9.8 - 0.59 * (71 * cos(54.7°))]
#E4 = Calculator[#E3 / 0.8]

Plan: Calculate the rate of acceleration of the broom.
