A massive light hangs over the table in Jeremy's dining room. The light is supported by three strong chains which make an angle of 80.0° with the horizontal. The force in each chain is 38 N. Determine the mass of the light.
To determine the mass of the light hanging in Jeremy's dining room, we need to break down the problem into several steps involving physics principles and mathematical calculations. Here is a detailed step-by-step plan:

### Plan
1. **Resolve the forces in the vertical direction:**
   - Each chain supports a portion of the light's weight, and the vertical component of the force in each chain contributes to the total weight.
   - We need to calculate the vertical component of the force in one chain.
   - Use trigonometric functions to resolve the force into vertical components.

2. **Sum the vertical components to find the total weight:**
   - Since there are three chains, sum the vertical components of the force from each chain to find the total weight of the light.

3. **Calculate the mass of the light:**
   - Use the relationship between weight and mass (Weight = Mass * Gravity) to find the mass of the light.

### Step-by-Step Plan

#### Step 1: Resolve the forces in the vertical direction
Plan: Calculate the vertical component of the force in one chain using trigonometric functions.
#E1 = Calculator[38 * cos(80°)]

#### Step 2: Sum the vertical components to find the total weight

Aaron Agin nodded off while driving home from play practice this past Sunday evening. His 1650-kg car hit a series of guardrails while moving at 18.5 m/s. The first guard rail delivered a resistive impulse of 4780 N*s. The second guard rail pushed against his car with a force of 84000 N for 0.1 seconds. The third guard rail collision lowered the car's velocity by 2.6 m/s. Determine the final velocity of the car.
To determine the final velocity of Aaron Agin's car after it hit a series of guardrails, we need to account for the changes in momentum due to the resistive impulses and forces applied during each collision. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### Step 1: Calculate the change in velocity due to the first guard rail collision.
- **Plan:** Use the impulse-momentum theorem to find the change in velocity from the first guard rail.
- **Tool:** Calculator
- **Input:** \(\Delta v_1 = \frac{Impulse}{mass} = \frac{4780 \, \text{N*s}}{1650 \, \text{kg}}\)
- **#E1:** Calculator[\(\Delta v_1 = \frac{4780}{1650}\)]

#### Step 2: Calculate the change in velocity due to the second guard rail collision.
- **Plan:** Use the impulse-momentum theorem to find the change in velocity from the second guard rail.
- **Tool:** Calculator
- **Input:** \(\Delta v_2 = \frac{Force \times Time}{mass} = \frac{84000 \, \text{N} \times 0

A California Condor is approaching its nest with a large chunk of carrion in its beak. As it approaches, it makes an upward swoop, achieving a momentary upward velocity of 9.4 m/s when the carrion falls from its mouth, hitting a cliff outcropping 45.4 m below. Determine the speed of the carrion upon hitting the outcropping.
To determine the speed of the carrion upon hitting the outcropping, we need to consider the principles of physics, specifically the equations of motion under gravity. We can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Determine the initial conditions and setup the equations of motion.**
2. **Calculate the time it takes for the carrion to fall 45.4 meters.**
3. **Calculate the final velocity of the carrion just before it hits the outcropping.**

Let's proceed with the detailed plans and evidence retrieval:

### Plan 1: Determine the initial conditions and setup the equations of motion.
- The carrion has an initial upward velocity of 9.4 m/s.
- The displacement is 45.4 meters downward.
- We need to use the equations of motion under gravity.

### Plan 2: Calculate the time it takes for the carrion to fall 45.4 meters.
- Use the equation of motion: \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \)
- Here, \( s = -45.4 \) meters (downward), \( u = 9.4 \) m/s (upward), and \( g = 9.8 \) m/s²

Renatta Gass is out with her friends. Misfortune occurs and Renatta and her friends find themselves getting a workout. They apply a cumulative force of 740 N to push the car 132 m to the nearest fuel station. Determine the work done on the car.
To determine the work done on the car, we need to use the formula for work in physics, which is given by:

\[ \text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \times \cos(\theta) \]

Since the problem doesn't mention any angle (\(\theta\)), we assume the force is applied in the direction of the motion, making \(\theta = 0^\circ\) and \(\cos(0^\circ) = 1\).

Let's break down the steps:

### Plan:
1. **Identify the values given:**
   - Force (\(F\)) = 740 N
   - Distance (\(d\)) = 132 m
   - Angle (\(\theta\)) = 0° (implied)

2. **Calculate the work done using the formula:**
   \[ \text{Work} = F \times d \times \cos(\theta) \]

### Steps:
1. **Retrieve the values of Force and Distance.**
   - Given directly in the problem statement.

2. **Calculate the Work using the formula.**

### Calculation:
\[ \text{Work} = 740 \, \text{N} \times 132 \

During an in-class demonstration of momentum change and impulse, Mr. H asks Jerome (67 kg) and Michael (82 kg) to sit on a large 18-kg skate cart. Mr. H asks Suzie (45 kg) to sit on a second 10-kg skate cart. The two carts are placed on low friction boards in the hallway. Jerome pushes off of Suzie's cart. Measurements are made to determine that Suzie's cart acquired a post-impulse speed of 7.2 m/s. Determine the expected recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart.
To solve the problem of determining the expected recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart, we need to use the principles of conservation of momentum. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

### Plan:
1. **Calculate the total mass of each cart system:**
   - Jerome and Michael's cart: \( m_1 = 67 \text{ kg} + 82 \text{ kg} + 18 \text{ kg} \)
   - Suzie's cart: \( m_2 = 45 \text{ kg} + 10 \text{ kg} \)

2. **Use the conservation of momentum principle:**
   - Initial momentum before the push is zero because both carts are initially at rest.
   - Final momentum after the push should also be zero because the system is closed and no external forces act on it.
   - Therefore, the momentum of Jerome and Michael's cart system should equal the negative of Suzie's cart system.

3. **Set up the equation for conservation of momentum and solve for the recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart system:**
   - \( m_2 \times v_2 = -m_1 \times v_1 \)
   - Solve for \( v_1

The rescue basket is lowered to the roof and some occupants of the top floor escape to the roof and enter the basket. As the helicopter takes off, the cable momentarily makes a 80° angle to the horizontal, imparting a slight horizontal acceleration to the 654-kg basket and occupants across the roof top. The coefficient of friction between the basket and the roof top is 0.6 and the tension in the cable is 5250 N. Determine the acceleration of the basket and occupants.
Sure, let's break down the problem step-by-step and retrieve the necessary evidence using the appropriate external tools.

### Step-by-Step Plan

**Step 1: Calculate the horizontal component of the tension in the cable.**

- Tool: Calculator
- Input: \( T_{\text{horizontal}} = 5250 \times \cos(80^\circ) \)
- #E1 = Calculator[5250 * cos(80)]

**Step 2: Calculate the vertical component of the tension in the cable.**
- Plan: Use trigonometry to find the vertical component of the tension (T_vertical).
- Tool: Calculator
- Input: \( T_{\text{vertical}} = 5250 \times \sin(80^\circ) \)
- #E2 = Calculator[5250 * sin(80)]

**Step 3: Determine the normal force acting on the basket and occupants.**

The coefficient of friction between the basket and the roof top is 0.6 and the tension in the cable is 5250 N. Determine the acceleration of the basket and occupants.
To determine the acceleration of the basket and occupants, we start by analyzing the forces acting on the basket.

Given:
- Mass of the basket and occupants, \( m = 654 \, \text{kg} \)
- Tension in the cable, \( T = 5250 \, \text{N} \)
- Angle of the cable with the horizontal, \( \theta = 80^\circ \)
- Coefficient of friction, \( \mu = 0.6 \)

First, we decompose the tension \( T \) into its horizontal and vertical components:
- Horizontal component, \( T_x = T \cos(\theta) \)
- Vertical component, \( T_y = T \sin(\theta) \)

Calculating these components:
\[ T_x = 5250 \cos(80^\circ) \]
\[ T_x \approx 5250 \times 0.1736 \]
\[ T_x \approx 911.4 \, \text{N} \]

\[ T_y = 5250 \sin(80^\circ) \]
\[ T_y \approx 5250 \times 0.9848 \]
\[ T_y \approx 5160.2 \, \text{

- Coefficient of friction, \( \mu = 0.6 \)

First, we decompose the tension \( T \) into its horizontal and vertical components:
- Horizontal component, \( T_x = T \cos(\theta) \)
- Vertical component, \( T_y = T \sin(\theta) \)

Calculating these components:
\[ T_x = 5250 \cos(80^\circ) \]
\[ T_x \approx 5250 \times 0.1736 \]
\[ T_x \approx 911.4 \, \text{N} \]

\[ T_y = 5250 \sin(80^\circ) \]
\[ T_y \approx 5250 \times 0.9848 \]
\[ T_y \approx 5160.2 \, \text{

Rosa Boat is paddling upstream at 1.5 m/s relative to the water in a river which is flowing at 0.60 m/s relative to the banks of the river. What is the resultant upstream velocity of Rosa's boat (relative to the banks)?
Sure, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Rosa is paddling upstream at a speed of 1.5 m/s relative to the water. The river is flowing downstream at a speed of 0.60 m/s relative to the banks. To find the resultant upstream velocity of Rosa's boat relative to the banks, we need to subtract the speed of the river's flow from Rosa's paddling speed.

### Step 2: Formulate the Calculation
The resultant velocity \( V_r \) can be calculated using the equation:
\[ V_r = V_p - V_f \]
where:
- \( V_p \) is the paddling speed of Rosa relative to the water (1.5 m/s).
- \( V_f \) is the flow speed of the river relative to the banks (0.60 m/s).

### Step 3: Perform the Calculation
We'll use the Calculator tool to perform this arithmetic operation.

**Plan:** Calculate the resultant upstream velocity of Rosa's boat relative to the banks.
\[ V_r = 1.5 \, \text{m/s} - 0.60 \, \text{m/s} \]

Claire de Iles is shopping. She walks 33 m to the end of an aisle. She then makes a right hand turn and walks 25 m down the end aisle. Determine the magnitude of Claire's resultant displacement.
To determine the magnitude of Claire's resultant displacement, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. This is because Claire's path forms a right-angled triangle, where the legs of the triangle are the distances she walked along the two perpendicular aisles. The resultant displacement will be the hypotenuse of this triangle.

### Plan:
1. **Translate the problem into a mathematical expression using the Pythagorean theorem.**
   - Given: Claire walks 33 m in one direction and 25 m in a perpendicular direction.
   - We need to find the hypotenuse \( c \) of the right-angled triangle where the legs are 33 m and 25 m.
   - The formula for the hypotenuse \( c \) is: \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \)
   - Here, \( a = 33 \) m and \( b = 25 \) m.

A candy-filled piñata is hung from a tree for Matthew's birthday. During an unsuccessful attempt to break the 3-kg piñata, Hayden cracks it with a 0.6-kg stick moving at 2.5 m/s. The stick stops and the piñata undergoes a gentle swinging motion. Determine the swing speed of the piñata immediately after being cracked by the stick.
To determine the swing speed of the piñata immediately after being cracked by the stick, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the initial momentum of the stick before impact.**
2. **Since the stick stops after impact, the final momentum of the stick is zero.**
3. **Using the conservation of momentum, calculate the swing speed of the piñata immediately after impact.**

### Step 1: Calculate the initial momentum of the stick

Plan: Use the formula for momentum \( p = mv \) where \( m \) is the mass and \( v \) is the velocity.
#E1 = Calculator[0.6 * 2.5]

### Step 2: Apply the conservation of momentum principle

Plan: Use the conservation of momentum principle which states that the total momentum before impact is equal to the total momentum after impact. Given that the stick stops after hitting the piñata, the piñata will have the same momentum as the initial momentum of the stick.
#E2 = LLM[Calculate the swing speed of the piñata using the momentum calculated in #E1 and the mass of the piñata.]

During a recent morning run, Ken averaged a speed of 5.9 m/s for 14.9 minutes. Ken then averaged a speed of 6.25 m/s for 5.1 minutes. Determine the total distance which Ken ran during his 20 minute jog.
To determine the total distance Ken ran during his 20-minute jog, we need to calculate the distance covered in each segment of his run and then sum these distances. The distance can be calculated using the formula:

Anna Litical and Noah Formula are doing The Cart and the Brick Lab. They drop a brick on a 3.2 kg cart moving at 13.2 cm/s. After the collision, the dropped brick and cart are moving together with a velocity of 8.3 cm/s. Determine the mass of the dropped brick.
To determine the mass of the dropped brick, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision should equal the total momentum after the collision. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

### Plan
1. **Identify the known variables:**
   - Mass of the cart (\(m_{cart}\)): 3.2 kg
   - Initial velocity of the cart (\(v_{cart}\)): 13.2 cm/s (0.132 m/s)
   - Final velocity of the cart and brick (\(v_{final}\)): 8.3 cm/s (0.083 m/s)

2. **Set up the equation for conservation of momentum:**
   - Initial momentum: \(m_{cart} \times v_{cart}\)
   - Final momentum: \((m_{cart} + m_{brick}) \times v_{final}\)
   - Equation: \(m_{cart} \times v_{cart} = (m_{cart} + m_{brick}) \times v_{final}\)

Ima Rilla Saari rushes to her car in order to hurry home and get dressed for work. Failing to realize the dangers of driving under slick and icy conditions, she collides her 950-kg Mazda Miata into the rear of a 2600-kg pick-up truck which was at rest at the light on Lake Avenue. Ima's pre-collision speed was 11.5 m/s. Determine the post-collision speed of the two entangled cars as they slide across the ice.
To solve this problem, we will use the principle of conservation of momentum. The momentum before the collision must be equal to the momentum after the collision since there are no external forces acting on the system. 

The formula for conservation of momentum in a collision is:
\[ m_1 \cdot v_1 + m_2 \cdot v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) \cdot v_f \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two vehicles.
- \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) are the velocities of the two vehicles before the collision.
- \( v_f \) is the final velocity of the two vehicles after the collision.

Given:
- \( m_1 = 950 \) kg (mass of Mazda Miata)
- \( v_1 = 11.5 \) m/s (velocity of Mazda Miata before collision)
- \( m_2 = 2600 \) kg (mass of pick-up truck)
- \( v_2 = 0 \) m/s (velocity of pick-up truck before collision)

We need to find \( v_f \).

An airplane begins its journey into Canada from a destination located 350 mi south of the border. The plane flies along a straight-line path at 196 mi/h in a direction of 25 degrees west of north. Determine the number of minutes before the plane crosses the border. Assume that the border is aligned directly east and west in the region where the flight takes place.
To solve the problem of determining the number of minutes before the airplane crosses the border, we need to use some trigonometry and basic arithmetic calculations. We'll break down the problem step-by-step and use the appropriate tools to find the solution.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Identify the components of the airplane's velocity:**
   - The airplane's velocity can be broken down into northward and westward components using trigonometric functions. Given the angle of 25 degrees west of north, we can use sine and cosine functions to find these components.

2. **Calculate the northward component of the velocity:**
   - Use the cosine function to find the northward component of the airplane's velocity.

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the northward distance:**
   - Use the northward component of the velocity to determine the time taken to travel 350 miles north.

4. **Convert the time from hours to minutes:**
   - Since the final answer needs to be in minutes, convert the time from hours to minutes.

Determine the number of minutes before the plane crosses the border. Assume that the border is aligned directly east and west in the region where the flight takes place.
To find the number of minutes before the plane crosses the border, we need to calculate the northward component of the plane's velocity and then determine the time it takes to cover the 350 miles to the border.

The northward component of the velocity \( V_n \) can be found using the formula:
\[ V_n = V \cos(\theta) \]
where \( V \) is the speed of the plane (196 mi/h) and \( \theta \) is the angle west of north (25 degrees).

\[ V_n = 196 \cos(25^\circ) \]
\[ V_n \approx 196 \times 0.9063 \]
\[ V_n \approx 177.63 \text{ mi/h} \]

Next, we calculate the time \( t \) it takes to travel 350 miles northward:
\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{velocity}} = \frac{350 \text{ mi}}{177.63 \text{ mi/h}} \]

The takeoff speed of a military aircraft from an aircraft carrier is approximately 170 mi/hr relative to the air. They acquire this speed through a combination of a catapult system present on the aircraft carrier and the aircraft's jet propulsion system. A common strategy is to head the carrier and the plane into the wind. If a plane is taking off from an aircraft carrier which is moving at 55 mi/hr into a 30 mi/hr headwind, then what speed relative to the deck of the aircraft carrier must it obtain to takeoff?
Sure, let's break down the problem step-by-step and use the appropriate tools to find the solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The takeoff speed of the aircraft relative to the air is 170 mi/hr. The aircraft carrier is moving at 55 mi/hr into a 30 mi/hr headwind. We need to find the speed relative to the deck of the aircraft carrier that the plane must obtain to take off.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
The relative speed of the plane to the air is given by the sum of the speed of the plane relative to the deck, the speed of the carrier, and the speed of the headwind. 

\[ \text{Speed of plane relative to air} = \text{Speed of plane relative to deck} + \text{Speed of carrier} + \text{Speed of headwind} \]

### Step 3: Substitute Known Values
\[ 170 = \text{Speed of plane relative to deck} + 55 + 30 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
\[ 170 = \text{Speed of plane relative to deck} + 85 \]

### Step 5: Solve for Speed of Plane Relative to Deck

An emergency relief plane is dropping a care package from a plane to a group of medical personnel working for a relief agency in an African village. The package is designed to land in a small lake, inflate an attached raft upon impact, and finally resurface with the raft side down. The plane will be moving horizontally with a ground speed of 54 m/s. The package will be dropped a horizontal distance of 486 m from the intended target location. At what altitude above the pond must the plane be flying in order to successfully accomplish this feat?
To solve this problem step-by-step, we need to determine the altitude from which the plane should drop the package to ensure it lands 486 meters horizontally from the drop point. This involves understanding the physics of projectile motion. Here's the detailed plan:

### Plan:

1. **Determine the time it takes for the package to travel 486 meters horizontally.**
    - Given the horizontal speed of the plane (54 m/s) and the horizontal distance (486 m), we can use the formula for horizontal motion:
      \[
      t = \frac{d}{v}
      \]
    - Where \( t \) is the time, \( d \) is the distance (486 m), and \( v \) is the horizontal speed (54 m/s).

2. **Calculate the time of flight using a Calculator.**
    - Input: \( t = \frac{486}{54} \)
    - Tool: Calculator
    - Evidence: #E1

3. **Determine the altitude using the time of flight.**
    - Using the time of flight from #E1, we can calculate the altitude (h) using the formula for vertical free fall:
      \[
      h = \frac{1}{2} g t^2

While training for breeding season, a 365 gram male squirrel does 32 pushups in a minute, displacing its center of mass by a distance of 8 cm for each pushup. Determine the total work done on the squirrel while moving upward (32 times).
To determine the total work done on the squirrel while moving upward during its pushups, we need to use the formula for work done, which is:

\[ \text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \]

In this context, the force is the weight of the squirrel, and the distance is the total vertical displacement for all the pushups. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

### Plan

1. **Convert the weight of the squirrel from grams to kilograms**:
   - Weight in grams: 365 grams
   - Convert to kilograms: \( \text{Weight in kg} = \frac{365}{1000} \)

   **Tool**: Calculator
   **Input**: `365 / 1000`
   **#E1** = Calculator[365 / 1000]

2. **Calculate the force (weight) in Newtons**:
   - Force (Weight) = Mass (kg) × Gravitational acceleration (g = 9.8 m/s²)
   - Use the result from #E1 for mass in kg.

   **Tool**: Calculator

Hayden and Matthew are riding around the neighborhood on their scooters. Hayden is at rest when Matthew passes him moving at a constant speed of 0.5 m/s. After 1.5 seconds, Hayden decides to chase after Matthew, accelerating at 1.1 m/s/s. How much time must Hayden accelerate before he is side-by-side with Matthew?
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Hayden must accelerate to catch up with Matthew. This involves understanding the kinematics equations for both Hayden and Matthew. Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use the appropriate tools to derive the solution.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Formulate the kinematic equations for Matthew and Hayden:**
   - Matthew is moving at a constant speed of 0.5 m/s.
   - Hayden starts accelerating at 1.1 m/s² after 1.5 seconds.

2. **Determine the position of Matthew as a function of time:**
   - Use the equation for constant velocity: \(d = vt\).

3. **Determine the position of Hayden as a function of time:**
   - Use the equation for uniformly accelerated motion: \(d = \frac{1}{2}at^2\).

4. **Set up the equations to find the time when Hayden catches up with Matthew:**

Dominic is the star discus thrower on South's varsity track and field team. In last year's regional competition, Dominic whirled the 1.8 kg discus in a circle with a radius of 1.2 m, ultimately reaching a speed of 45 m/s before launch. Determine the net force acting upon the discus in the moments before launch.
To determine the net force acting upon the discus in the moments before launch, we need to calculate the centripetal force. The formula for centripetal force \( F \) is given by:

\[ F = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r} \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the discus (1.8 kg),
- \( v \) is the speed of the discus (45 m/s),
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle (1.2 m).

We will use the Calculator tool to perform the arithmetic calculations.

Plan: Calculate the centripetal force using the formula \( F = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r} \).

### Plan to Determine the Time for Outside Riders to Make One Complete Circle

#### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Calculate the circumference of the circle:**
   - To determine the time for the riders to make one complete circle, we first need to calculate the circumference of the circle. The formula for the circumference \(C\) of a circle is \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(r\) is the radius.

The custodians clean the field house gym floor between games at the annual Holiday Basketball Classic. Chuck exerts a force on a 1.25-kg push broom as he walks across the floor at a constant speed. The coefficient of friction between the floor and the broom is 0.4 and the broom handle makes an angle of 35° with the horizontal. Determine the amount of force with which Chuck pushes downward (along the handle of the broom) in order to achieve this constant speed motion.
To determine the amount of force with which Chuck pushes downward along the handle of the broom, we need to consider the forces acting on the broom and use the principles of physics, particularly Newton's laws of motion and friction. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

### Plan:

1. **Identify the forces acting on the broom:**
   - The gravitational force acting downward (weight of the broom).
   - The normal force exerted by the floor on the broom.
   - The frictional force opposing the motion.
   - The force exerted by Chuck along the handle of the broom.

2. **Break down the force exerted by Chuck into its horizontal and vertical components:**
   - The horizontal component of the force contributes to overcoming friction.
   - The vertical component of the force affects the normal force.

3. **Use the coefficient of friction to relate the normal force and the frictional force:**
   - Frictional force = coefficient of friction * normal force.

4. **Set up the equations of motion to solve for the force exerted by Chuck:**
   - Use Newton's second law in the horizontal direction to relate the horizontal component of Chuck's force and the frictional force.

A bicycle has a momentum of 24 kg*m/s. What momentum would the bicycle have if it had one-half the mass and was moving with thrice the speed?
To solve the problem of determining the new momentum of the bicycle when its mass is halved and its speed is tripled, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the initial mass and speed of the bicycle**:
   - Given the momentum \( p = 24 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \).
   - Momentum \( p \) is given by the formula \( p = m \cdot v \).
   - We need to find the initial mass \( m \) and velocity \( v \).

2. **Calculate the new mass and speed**:
   - Halve the initial mass \( m \).
   - Triple the initial speed \( v \).

3. **Calculate the new momentum**:
   - Use the new mass and new speed to find the new momentum using the formula \( p = m \cdot v \).

Let's break this down into specific plans and use the appropriate tools to retrieve evidence.

### Plan 1: Determine the initial mass and speed
Given \( p = m \cdot v = 24 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \), we need to express \( m \) and \( v \

Helen is parasailing. She sits in a seat harness which is attached by a tow rope to a speedboat. The rope makes an angle of 62° with the horizontal and has a tension of 300 N. Determine the horizontal components of the tension force.
To determine the horizontal components of the tension force in Helen's parasailing scenario, we can use trigonometric principles. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:

1. **Plan**: Use trigonometric functions to find the horizontal component of the tension force. Specifically, we will use the cosine function since it relates the horizontal component to the tension and the angle with the horizontal.
   - The formula for the horizontal component \( F_x \) is: 
     \[
     F_x = T \cdot \cos(\theta)
     \]
     where \( T \) is the tension (300 N) and \( \theta \) is the angle (62°).

2. **Plan**: Calculate the cosine of 62° using a calculator.
   - Input: Calculate \(\cos(62°)\).
   - Tool: Calculator[cos(62)]

   #E1 = Calculator[cos(62)]

3. **Plan**: Multiply the tension force by the cosine of the angle to find the horizontal component.
   - Input: Calculate \( 300 \times \#E1 \).
   - Tool: Calculator[300 * \#E1]

An 76-kg male and a 51-kg female pair figure skating team are gliding across the ice at 6.4 m/s, preparing for a throw jump maneuver. The male skater tosses the female skater forward with a speed of 9 m/s. Determine the speed of the male skater immediately after the throw.
To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum of the system (the male and female skaters) before the throw must be equal to the total momentum after the throw. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the initial momentum of the system:** 
   - The initial momentum is the combined momentum of both skaters gliding together at 6.4 m/s.

2. **Set up the equation for conservation of momentum:** 
   - The initial momentum of the system equals the final momentum of the system (male skater's final momentum plus female skater's final momentum).

3. **Solve the equation for the male skater's final speed.**

### Plan and Execution

**Plan:** Calculate the initial momentum of the system.
   - \( \text{Initial Momentum} = (m_{\text{male}} + m_{\text{female}}) \times v_{\text{initial}} \)

Hector is walking his dog (Fido) around the neighborhood. Upon arriving at Fidella's house (a friend of Fido's), Fido turns part mule and refuses to continue on the walk. Hector yanks on the chain with a 72.0 N force at an angle of 35.0° above the horizontal. Determine the horizontal components of the tension force.
Sure, let's solve the problem step-by-step and retrieve evidence using the appropriate external tools.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Hector exerts a force of 72.0 N at an angle of 35.0° above the horizontal.
   - We need to determine the horizontal component of this force.

2. **Translate the Problem into a Mathematical Expression:**
   - The horizontal component \( F_{\text{horizontal}} \) of the force can be found using the cosine function in trigonometry:
     \[
     F_{\text{horizontal}} = F \cdot \cos(\theta)
     \]
   - Here, \( F = 72.0 \, \text{N} \) and \( \theta = 35.0° \).

3. **Calculate the Horizontal Component using a Calculator:**
   - Input the expression \( 72.0 \cdot \cos(35.0°) \) into the calculator to find the horizontal component.

### Execution

Alejandra is attempting to drag her 38-kg Golden Retriever across the wooden floor by applying a horizontal force. What force must she apply to move the dog with a constant speed of 1.5 m/s? The coefficient of friction between the dog and the floor is 0.72.
Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use the appropriate tools to find the solution.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Identify the given information and the formula needed:**
   - Mass of the dog \( m = 38 \) kg
   - Coefficient of friction \( \mu = 0.72 \)
   - Constant speed \( v = 1.5 \) m/s (Note that speed is constant, so acceleration \( a = 0 \))

   The required force \( F \) can be found using the formula for frictional force:
   \[
   F = \mu \cdot m \cdot g
   \]
   where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( g \approx 9.81 \) m/s\(^2\)).

2. **Calculate the gravitational force (weight) acting on the dog:**
   \[
   F_{\text{gravity}} = m \cdot g
   \]

   **Plan:** Use the Calculator tool to compute the gravitational force.
   \[
   \text{Calculator}[38 \times 9.81]
   \]
   **#E1:** Store the result in a variable.

A tortoise and a hare are having a 1500-meter race. The tortoise runs the race at a constant speed of 2.50 cm/s. The hare moves at an average speed of 1.50 m/s for 10.0 minutes and then decides to take a nap. After waking up from the nap, the hare recognizes that the tortoise is about to cross the finish line and immediately accelerates from rest with a constant acceleration of 0.8 m/s/s for the remaining distance of the race. If the tortoise wins by a hair (no pun intended), then what is the time in hours that the hare napped?
To solve this problem step-by-step, we need to break it down into manageable parts and use the appropriate tools to gather the necessary evidence. Here's the detailed plan:

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken by the tortoise to complete the race.

1. **Plan**: Calculate the time taken by the tortoise to complete the 1500-meter race at a constant speed of 2.50 cm/s.
2. **Tool**: Calculator
3. **Input**: Convert the speed from cm/s to m/s and then calculate the time.
   \[
   \text{Speed of tortoise} = 2.50 \, \text{cm/s} = 0.025 \, \text{m/s}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1500 \, \text{m}}{0.025 \, \text{m/s}}
   \]
4. **Output**: Time taken by the tortoise.
5. **Evidence**: #E1 = Calculator[1500 / 0.025]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance covered by the hare during the initial 10.

Cassie has just finished her session on the trampoline during PE. As she prepares to exit the trampoline, her vertical momentum is reduced by a series of three resistive impulses with the bounce mat. Just prior to this series of impulses, her 51.5-kg body is moving downward at 8.50 m/s. On the first impulse, Cassie experiences an average upward force of 235 N for 0.72 seconds. The second impulse of 76 N*s lasts for 0.48 seconds. The last impulse involves an average upward force of 116 N which cases a 92 kg*m/s momentum change. What vertical velocity does Cassie have after these three impulses?
To determine Cassie's vertical velocity after the three impulses, we need to calculate the change in momentum for each impulse and then update her velocity accordingly. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Calculate the momentum change for the first impulse**:
   - Use the formula: \( \Delta p_1 = F_1 \times t_1 \)
   - Given \( F_1 = 235 \, \text{N} \) and \( t_1 = 0.72 \, \text{s} \)

2. **Calculate the momentum change for the second impulse**:
   - Given directly as \( \Delta p_2 = 76 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)

3. **Calculate the momentum change for the third impulse**:
   - Given directly as \( \Delta p_3 = 92 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \)

4. **Calculate the total momentum change**:
   - Combine the momentum changes: \( \Delta p_{\text{total}} = \Delta p_1 + \Delta p_2 + \Delta p_3 \)

Lamar Gant, U.S. powerlifting star, became the first man to deadlift five times his own body weight in 1985. Deadlifting involves raising a loaded barbell from the floor to a position above the head with outstretched arms. Determine the work done by Lamar in deadlifting 260 kg to a height of 0.85 m above the ground.
Sure, let's break down the task step-by-step to determine the work done by Lamar Gant in deadlifting 260 kg to a height of 0.85 meters above the ground. We'll use the formula for work done, which is:
