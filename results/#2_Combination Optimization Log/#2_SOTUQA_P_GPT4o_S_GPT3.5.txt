Based on State of the Union Address 2023: Why the U.S. tax system is unfair ?
The U.S. tax system is unfair because it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and allows for loopholes and deductions that lower-income individuals cannot access.

 질문 Based on State of the Union Address 2023: Why the U.S. tax system is unfair ? 
 정답 The U.S. tax system is considered unfair because big corporations and the wealthy often pay little to no taxes while middle-class and low-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. For example, in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes.
