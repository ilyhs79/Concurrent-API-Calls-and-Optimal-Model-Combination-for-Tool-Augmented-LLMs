Aaron Agin nodded off while driving home from play practice this past Sunday evening. His 1650-kg car hit a series of guardrails while moving at 18.5 m/s. The first guard rail delivered a resistive impulse of 4780 N*s. The second guard rail pushed against his car with a force of 84000 N for 0.1 seconds. The third guard rail collision lowered the car's velocity by 2.6 m/s. Determine the final velocity of the car.

During a recent morning run, Ken averaged a speed of 5.9 m/s for 14.9 minutes. Ken then averaged a speed of 6.25 m/s for 5.1 minutes. Determine the total distance which Ken ran during his 20 minute jog.

First part of the jog:
Speed = 5.9 m/s
Time = 14.9 minutes = 14.9 * 60 seconds = 894 seconds
Distance = Speed * Time = 5.9 * 894 = 5274.6 meters

Second part of the jog:
Speed = 6.25 m/s
Time = 5.1 minutes = 5.1 * 60 seconds = 306 seconds
Distance = Speed * Time = 6.25 * 306 = 1912.5 meters

Total distance = 5274.6 + 1912.5 = 7187.1 meters

The takeoff speed of a military aircraft from an aircraft carrier is approximately 170 mi/hr relative to the air. They acquire this speed through a combination of a catapult system present on the aircraft carrier and the aircraft's jet propulsion system. A common strategy is to head the carrier and the plane into the wind. If a plane is taking off from an aircraft carrier which is moving at 55 mi/hr into a 30 mi/hr headwind, then what speed relative to the deck of the aircraft carrier must it obtain to takeoff?
Plan: Use the given information to calculate the speed the aircraft carrier must be moving at in order for the plane to take off.

A tortoise and a hare are having a 1500-meter race. The tortoise runs the race at a constant speed of 2.50 cm/s. The hare moves at an average speed of 1.50 m/s for 10.0 minutes and then decides to take a nap. After waking up from the nap, the hare recognizes that the tortoise is about to cross the finish line and immediately accelerates from rest with a constant acceleration of 0.8 m/s/s for the remaining distance of the race. If the tortoise wins by a hair (no pun intended), then what is the time in hours that the hare napped?
To find the time the hare napped, we need to calculate the time it took for both the tortoise and the hare to finish the race and then determine the difference.

First, let's find the time it takes for the tortoise to finish the race.

Tortoise's speed is 2.50 cm/s, which is 0.025 m/s. The distance is 1500 meters.

\[ \text{Time for tortoise} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1500 \text{ m}}{0.025 \text{ m/s}} = 60000 \text{ s} \]

Convert this time into hours:

\[ 60000 \text{ s} \times \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{3600 \text{ s}} = 16.6667 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's find the time it takes for the hare to finish the race.

1. The hare runs at 1.50 m/s for 10.0 minutes (600 seconds).

\[ \text{Distance covered by hare in 10 minutes} = 1.50 \text{ m/s} \times 600 \text{ s} =
