A massive light hangs over the table in Jeremy's dining room. The light is supported by three strong chains which make an angle of 80.0° with the horizontal. The force in each chain is 38 N. Determine the mass of the light.
To determine the mass of the light, we need to analyze the forces involved. The light is supported by three chains, each making an angle of 80.0° with the horizontal, and each chain exerts a force of 38 N. We can use principles of physics, specifically the equilibrium of forces and trigonometry, to solve this problem.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Analyze the vertical component of the forces in the chains to find the total upward force.**
   - Each chain exerts a force of 38 N at an angle of 80.0° with the horizontal.
   - The vertical component of the force in each chain can be found using trigonometry: \( F_{\text{vertical}} = F \cdot \sin(\theta) \).
   - The total upward force is the sum of the vertical components of the forces in all three chains.

2. **Calculate the total upward force.**
   - Use the formula for the vertical component and multiply it by 3 (since there are three chains).

3. **Determine the mass of the light using the total upward force.**
   - The total upward force must equal the weight of the light (mass \(\times\) gravitational acceleration, \( g

Aaron Agin nodded off while driving home from play practice this past Sunday evening. His 1650-kg car hit a series of guardrails while moving at 18.5 m/s. The first guard rail delivered a resistive impulse of 4780 N*s. The second guard rail pushed against his car with a force of 84000 N for 0.1 seconds. The third guard rail collision lowered the car's velocity by 2.6 m/s. Determine the final velocity of the car.
Sure, let's break down the problem step-by-step and solve it using the appropriate tools. 

### Plan:
1. **Calculate the velocity change due to the first guard rail.**
   - Use the impulse-momentum theorem which states \( \Delta p = J \), where \( \Delta p \) is the change in momentum and \( J \) is the impulse.
   - The change in momentum \( \Delta p = m \Delta v \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( \Delta v \) is the change in velocity.
   - Given \( J = 4780 \) N*s and \( m = 1650 \) kg, solve for \( \Delta v \).

A California Condor is approaching its nest with a large chunk of carrion in its beak. As it approaches, it makes an upward swoop, achieving a momentary upward velocity of 9.4 m/s when the carrion falls from its mouth, hitting a cliff outcropping 45.4 m below. Determine the speed of the carrion upon hitting the outcropping.
Sure, let's break down the problem step-by-step and determine which tools to use at each step. The problem involves physics, specifically kinematics, so we will need to use equations of motion.

### Step-by-Step Plan

#### Step 1: Identify the known variables and the equations of motion
- Initial upward velocity (\(v_0\)) = 9.4 m/s
- Displacement (\(s\)) = -45.4 m (negative because it falls down)
- Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) = 9.8 m/s² (downward)

We need to find the final velocity (\(v\)) of the carrion when it hits the cliff outcropping.

#### Step 2: Use the kinematic equation to solve for the final velocity
The kinematic equation that relates these variables is:

\[ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2as \]

Where:
- \(v\) is the final velocity
- \(v_0\) is the initial velocity
- \(a\) is the acceleration (which will be \(g\) in this case)
- \(s\) is the displacement

We can solve for \(v\) using this equation.

While playing basketball in PE class, Logan lost his balance after making a lay-up and colliding with the padded wall behind the basket. His 78-kg body decelerated from 8 m/s to 0 m/s in 0.2 seconds.
To solve the problem of determining the force exerted on Logan's body when he decelerated from 8 m/s to 0 m/s in 0.2 seconds, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the deceleration (a):**
   - We need to use the formula for acceleration (deceleration in this case):
     \[
     a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}
     \]
   - Where \( v_f \) is the final velocity (0 m/s), \( v_i \) is the initial velocity (8 m/s), and \( t \) is the time (0.2 seconds).

2. **Calculate the force (F):**
   - We use Newton's second law of motion:
     \[
     F = m \times a
     \]
   - Where \( m \) is the mass (78 kg) and \( a \) is the deceleration we calculated in the previous step.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

Renatta Gass is out with her friends. Misfortune occurs and Renatta and her friends find themselves getting a workout. They apply a cumulative force of 740 N to push the car 132 m to the nearest fuel station. Determine the work done on the car.
To determine the work done on the car by Renatta Gass and her friends, we can use the formula for work done in physics:

\[ \text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \times \cos(\theta) \]

Since the problem does not specify the angle (\(\theta\)) between the force and the direction of motion, we will assume that the force is applied in the direction of the motion, making \(\cos(\theta) = 1\).

Plan: Calculate the work done using the given force and distance.
#E1 = Calculator[740 * 132]

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the work done using the given force and distance.**
    - Tool: Calculator
    - Input: 740 * 132

Executing this plan:

\[ \text{Work} = 740 \, \text{N} \times 132 \, \text{m} \]

#E1 = Calculator[740 * 132]

The work done on the car is:

\[ \text{Work} = 97680 \, \text{J} \]

Thus, the work done on the car is 97,680 Joules.

During an in-class demonstration of momentum change and impulse, Mr. H asks Jerome (67 kg) and Michael (82 kg) to sit on a large 18-kg skate cart. Mr. H asks Suzie (45 kg) to sit on a second 10-kg skate cart. The two carts are placed on low friction boards in the hallway. Jerome pushes off of Suzie's cart. Measurements are made to determine that Suzie's cart acquired a post-impulse speed of 7.2 m/s. Determine the expected recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart.
To determine the expected recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart, we need to use the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the push must equal the total momentum after the push. Here is the detailed plan to solve the problem:

### Plan:
1. **Determine the total mass of each cart system.**
    - Jerome, Michael, and their cart.
    - Suzie and her cart.
2. **Calculate the initial momentum of the system before the push.**
    - Since both carts are initially at rest, their initial momentum is zero.
3. **Calculate the momentum of Suzie's cart after the push.**
    - Use the mass of Suzie and her cart and the given speed.
4. **Apply the conservation of momentum to find the recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart.**
    - Use the calculated momentum of Suzie's cart to find the recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### Step 1: Determine the total mass of each cart system.
- Jerome and Michael's cart:
    - Mass of Jerome: 67 kg
    - Mass of Michael: 82 kg
    - Mass of the cart: 18 kg

Rosa Boat is paddling upstream at 1.5 m/s relative to the water in a river which is flowing at 0.60 m/s relative to the banks of the river. What is the resultant upstream velocity of Rosa's boat (relative to the banks)?
### Plan
1. Understand the problem: Rosa is paddling upstream at 1.5 m/s relative to the water, and the river is flowing downstream at 0.60 m/s relative to the banks. The resultant upstream velocity relative to the banks will be the difference between Rosa's paddling speed and the river's flow speed.

2. Translate the problem into a mathematical expression: The resultant velocity \( V_r \) can be found by subtracting the river's flow speed \( V_f \) from Rosa's paddling speed \( V_p \).

3. Compute the resultant velocity using a calculator.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

#### Step 1: Translate the problem into a mathematical expression
Plan: Formulate the equation for the resultant velocity.
\[ V_r = V_p - V_f \]
Where:
- \( V_p \) = 1.5 m/s (paddling speed relative to the water)
- \( V_f \) = 0.60 m/s (river's flow speed relative to the banks)

#### Step 2: Compute the resultant velocity using a calculator
#E1 = Calculator[1.5 - 0.60]

Claire de Iles is shopping. She walks 33 m to the end of an aisle. She then makes a right hand turn and walks 25 m down the end aisle. Determine the magnitude of Claire's resultant displacement.
To determine the magnitude of Claire's resultant displacement, we can treat her path as a right-angled triangle, where the two legs of the triangle are the distances she walked along the two aisles. The displacement will be the hypotenuse of this triangle. Here’s the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

### Plan
1. **Translate the problem into a mathematical expression**: 
   - Claire's path forms a right-angled triangle with legs of 33 m and 25 m.
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the resultant displacement.
   - The formula is \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the legs of the triangle, and \( c \) is the hypotenuse.

### Step-by-Step Execution

**Plan**: Compute the mathematical expression using the Pythagorean theorem.
#E1 = Calculator[\(\sqrt{33^2 + 25^2}\)]

### Explanation
- **Calculator**: This tool will compute the square root of the sum of the squares of 33 and 25.

Once we have the result from #E1, we will have the magnitude of Claire's resultant displacement.

2. Determine the time it takes for one full rotation in seconds.
3. Calculate the speed of the riders in m/s using the circumference and the time.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

A candy-filled piñata is hung from a tree for Matthew's birthday. During an unsuccessful attempt to break the 3-kg piñata, Hayden cracks it with a 0.6-kg stick moving at 2.5 m/s. The stick stops and the piñata undergoes a gentle swinging motion. Determine the swing speed of the piñata immediately after being cracked by the stick.
To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of conservation of momentum. Here's a step-by-step plan to determine the swing speed of the piñata immediately after being cracked by the stick:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Identify the physical principles involved**:
   - Conservation of momentum: The total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision.

2. **Set up the equations**:
   - The initial momentum of the system (stick and piñata) is the sum of the momentum of the stick and the piñata.
   - The final momentum of the system is the momentum of the piñata, as the stick stops moving.

3. **Calculate the initial momentum of the stick**:
   - Use the formula: \( p = mv \), where \( m \) is mass and \( v \) is velocity.

4. **Calculate the final velocity of the piñata**:
   - Use the conservation of momentum equation: \( m_{\text{stick}} \cdot v_{\text{stick}} + m_{\text{piñata}} \cdot v_{\text{piñata}} = m_{\text{piñata}} \cdot v_{\text{piñata final

### Plan to Determine the Mass of the Dropped Brick

To solve this physics problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Here are the detailed steps:

#### Step 1: Identify the known variables and the formula to be used.
- Mass of the cart (m₁): 3.2 kg
- Initial velocity of the cart (v₁): 13.2 cm/s
- Final velocity of the cart and brick together (v₂): 8.3 cm/s
- Mass of the brick (m₂): ?

The formula for momentum conservation is:
\[ m₁ \cdot v₁ + m₂ \cdot 0 = (m₁ + m₂) \cdot v₂ \]

#### Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for the mass of the brick (m₂).
\[ m₂ = \frac{m₁ \cdot (v₁ - v₂)}{v₂} \]

#### Step 3: Compute the mass of the brick using the rearranged formula.
\[ m₂ = \frac{3.2 \cdot (13.2 - 8

Ima Rilla Saari rushes to her car in order to hurry home and get dressed for work. Failing to realize the dangers of driving under slick and icy conditions, she collides her 950-kg Mazda Miata into the rear of a 2600-kg pick-up truck which was at rest at the light on Lake Avenue. Ima's pre-collision speed was 11.5 m/s. Determine the post-collision speed of the two entangled cars as they slide across the ice.
To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of momentum. Here's a step-by-step plan to determine the post-collision speed of the two entangled cars:

### Step-by-Step Plan

**Plan 1:** Use the conservation of momentum to set up the equation for the collision.
- The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.
- The formula for momentum is \( p = mv \), where \( m \) is mass and \( v \) is velocity.

\[ m_1 \cdot v_1 + m_2 \cdot v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) \cdot v_f \]

Where:
- \( m_1 = 950 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Mazda Miata)
- \( v_1 = 11.5 \, \text{m/s} \) (velocity of the Mazda Miata before collision)
- \( m_2 = 2600 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the pick-up truck)
- \( v_2 = 0 \, \text{m/s} \) (velocity of the pick-up truck before collision, since it was

An airplane begins its journey into Canada from a destination located 350 mi south of the border. The plane flies along a straight-line path at 196 mi/h in a direction of 25 degrees west of north. Determine the number of minutes before the plane crosses the border. Assume that the border is aligned directly east and west in the region where the flight takes place.
To determine the number of minutes before the plane crosses the border, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps and use the appropriate tools to solve each part. Here is the detailed plan:

### Step-by-Step Plan

**Plan 1: Calculate the northward component of the plane's velocity.**
- We need to find the component of the plane's velocity in the northward direction. Since the plane is flying 25 degrees west of north, we can use trigonometric functions to find this component.
- Input: Use the cosine function to find the northward component of the velocity.
```plaintext
Calculator[196 * cos(25 degrees)]
```
**#E1:** Store the northward component of the velocity.

**Plan 2: Calculate the time it takes to travel 350 miles northward.**
- Given the northward component of the velocity from #E1, we can calculate the time it takes to travel 350 miles using the formula: time = distance / velocity.
- Input: Use the distance (350 miles) and the northward component of the velocity from #E1 to find the time.
```plaintext
Calculator[350 / #E1]
```
**#E2:** Store the time in hours it takes

The takeoff speed of a military aircraft from an aircraft carrier is approximately 170 mi/hr relative to the air. They acquire this speed through a combination of a catapult system present on the aircraft carrier and the aircraft's jet propulsion system. A common strategy is to head the carrier and the plane into the wind. If a plane is taking off from an aircraft carrier which is moving at 55 mi/hr into a 30 mi/hr headwind, then what speed relative to the deck of the aircraft carrier must it obtain to takeoff?
To solve the problem of determining the speed relative to the deck of the aircraft carrier that the plane must obtain to take off, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps and use the appropriate tools to gather evidence and perform calculations.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Understand the problem and break it down into components:**
   - The plane needs a takeoff speed of 170 mi/hr relative to the air.
   - The aircraft carrier is moving at 55 mi/hr into the wind.
   - There is a headwind of 30 mi/hr.

2. **Determine the effective wind speed relative to the carrier:**
   - Combine the speed of the carrier (55 mi/hr) with the headwind (30 mi/hr).

3. **Calculate the required speed of the plane relative to the deck of the aircraft carrier:**
   - Subtract the effective wind speed from the required takeoff speed relative to the air.

### Execution Plan

**Plan: Calculate the effective wind speed relative to the carrier.**
- The effective wind speed is the sum of the carrier speed and the headwind.

An emergency relief plane is dropping a care package from a plane to a group of medical personnel working for a relief agency in an African village. The package is designed to land in a small lake, inflate an attached raft upon impact, and finally resurface with the raft side down. The plane will be moving horizontally with a ground speed of 54 m/s. The package will be dropped a horizontal distance of 486 m from the intended target location. At what altitude above the pond must the plane be flying in order to successfully accomplish this feat?
To determine the altitude above the pond from which the plane must drop the care package, we need to solve for the vertical distance (altitude) using the given horizontal speed and distance. We can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. **Determine the time it takes for the package to travel horizontally**: We will use the horizontal distance and speed to find the time.
2. **Calculate the altitude using the time and gravitational acceleration**: We will use the time from step 1 and the constant acceleration due to gravity to find the altitude.

### Plan 1: Determine the time it takes for the package to travel horizontally

**Tool**: Calculator

**Input**: Calculate the time \( t \) it takes to travel 486 meters horizontally at a speed of 54 m/s.

While training for breeding season, a 365 gram male squirrel does 32 pushups in a minute, displacing its center of mass by a distance of 8 cm for each pushup. Determine the total work done on the squirrel while moving upward (32 times).
To determine the total work done on the squirrel while moving upward during 32 pushups, we need to calculate the work done in each pushup and then sum it up for all 32 pushups. The work done in each pushup can be calculated using the formula for work:

\[ \text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \]

Where:
- Force is the weight of the squirrel, which can be calculated using the mass and acceleration due to gravity.
- Distance is the displacement of the squirrel's center of mass in each pushup.

Here are the detailed plans:

### Plan 1: Calculate the weight (force) of the squirrel
1. **Convert the mass of the squirrel into kilograms.**
    - Given mass: 365 grams
    - Conversion: 1 kg = 1000 grams
    - Mass in kg = 365 / 1000 = 0.365 kg

2. **Calculate the weight (force) using the formula:**
    - Force = Mass \(\times\) Acceleration due to gravity (g)
    - Acceleration due to gravity, \( g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

Alexander's hobby is dirt biking. On one occasion last weekend, he accelerated from rest to 15.2 m/s/s in 2 seconds. He then maintained this speed for 9.5 seconds. Seeing a coyote cross the trail ahead of him, he abruptly stops in 3 seconds. Determine Alexander's average speed for this motion.
Average speed = total distance / total time

First, calculate the distance traveled during acceleration:
Distance = (initial velocity)(time) + (1/2)(acceleration)(time^2)
Distance = (0 m/s)(2 s) + (1/2)(15.2 m/s^2)(2 s)^2
Distance = 0 m + (1/2)(15.2 m/s^2)(4 s^2)
Distance = 0 m + 30.4 m
Distance = 30.4 m

Next, calculate the distance traveled at constant speed:
Distance = (constant speed)(time)
Distance = (15.2 m/s)(9.5 s)
Distance = 144.4 m

Finally, calculate the total distance:
Total distance = distance during acceleration + distance at constant speed
Total distance = 30.4 m + 144.4 m
Total distance = 174.8 m

Now, calculate the total time:
Total time = time to accelerate + time at constant speed + time to stop
Total time = 2 s + 9.5 s + 3 s
Total time = 14.5 s

Average speed = total distance / total time

Dominic is the star discus thrower on South's varsity track and field team. In last year's regional competition, Dominic whirled the 1.8 kg discus in a circle with a radius of 1.2 m, ultimately reaching a speed of 45 m/s before launch. Determine the net force acting upon the discus in the moments before launch.
To determine the net force acting upon the discus in the moments before launch, we need to use the formula for centripetal force. The formula is:

\[ F = \frac{mv^2}{r} \]

where:
- \( F \) is the centripetal force,
- \( m \) is the mass of the discus,
- \( v \) is the velocity of the discus,
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Given:
- \( m = 1.8 \) kg,
- \( v = 45 \) m/s,
- \( r = 1.2 \) m.

### Plan

1. **Calculate the centripetal force using the given values.**
   - Use the formula \( F = \frac{mv^2}{r} \) to compute the force.
   - Since this involves a straightforward mathematical calculation, we can use the Calculator tool.

\[ \text{Calculator}[F = \frac{1.8 \times 45^2}{1.2}] \]

The custodians clean the field house gym floor between games at the annual Holiday Basketball Classic. Chuck exerts a force on a 1.25-kg push broom as he walks across the floor at a constant speed. The coefficient of friction between the floor and the broom is 0.4 and the broom handle makes an angle of 35° with the horizontal. Determine the amount of force with which Chuck pushes downward (along the handle of the broom) in order to achieve this constant speed motion.
To solve this problem, we need to consider the forces acting on the broom and use principles of physics to determine the force Chuck exerts. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

### Plan:
1. **Identify the forces acting on the broom**:
   - The gravitational force (weight) acting downward.
   - The normal force exerted by the floor.
   - The frictional force opposing the motion.
   - The force Chuck exerts along the handle of the broom.

2. **Break down the force Chuck exerts into components**:
   - The vertical component of the force.
   - The horizontal component of the force.

3. **Set up the equations of motion**:
   - Use the equilibrium conditions since the broom is moving at a constant speed (net force in both horizontal and vertical directions is zero).

4. **Solve for the force Chuck exerts along the handle**:
   - Use trigonometric relationships to relate the components of the force to the angle of the handle.

Let's break it down into specific steps and use the appropriate tools to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

**Plan: Identify the forces acting on the broom and set up the equations of motion.**

\[ F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \times F_{\text{normal}} \]

where:
- \( \mu \) is the coefficient of friction.
- \( F_{\text{normal}} \) is the normal force, which in this case is equal to the weight of the dog.

The weight of the dog can be calculated using the formula:

\[ F_{\text{normal}} = m \times g \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the dog.
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

Once we have the frictional force, we can determine the force Alejandra must apply to overcome it and move the dog at a constant speed.

Plan: Calculate the normal force acting on the dog.
#E1 = Calculator[38 * 9.81]

Plan: Calculate the force of friction using the coefficient of friction and the normal force.

A tortoise and a hare are having a 1500-meter race. The tortoise runs the race at a constant speed of 2.50 cm/s. The hare moves at an average speed of 1.50 m/s for 10.0 minutes and then decides to take a nap. After waking up from the nap, the hare recognizes that the tortoise is about to cross the finish line and immediately accelerates from rest with a constant acceleration of 0.8 m/s/s for the remaining distance of the race. If the tortoise wins by a hair (no pun intended), then what is the time in hours that the hare napped?
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and use appropriate tools for each calculation. Here is a detailed plan:

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Calculate the time taken by the tortoise to complete the race.**
   - **Plan:** Convert the tortoise's speed from cm/s to m/s and then calculate the time taken to complete the 1500-meter race.

   - **Input:** \( \text{Time for tortoise} = \frac{1500 \text{ meters}}{2.50 \text{ cm/s} \times \frac{1 \text{ meter}}{100 \text{ cm}}} \)
   - **#E1:** Calculator[\( \frac{1500}{2.50 \times 0.01} \)]

2. **Calculate the distance covered by the hare before it starts napping.**
   - **Plan:** Convert the hare's speed to m/s and calculate the distance covered in 10 minutes.
   - **Tool:** Calculator
   - **Input:** \( \text{Distance covered by hare} = 1.50 \text{ m/s} \times 10 \text{ minutes} \

위키검색툴 결과 An inclined plane, also known as a ramp, is a flat supporting surface tilted at an angle from the vertical direction, with one end higher than the other, used as an aid for raising or lowering a load. The inclined plane is one of the six classical simple machines defined by Renaissance scientists. Inclined planes are used to move heavy loads over vertical obstacles. Examples vary from a ramp used to load goods into a truck, to a person walking up a pedestrian ramp, to an automobile or railroad train climbing a grade.
Moving an object up an inclined plane requires less force than lifting it straight up, at a cost of an increase in the distance moved. The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane, the factor by which the force is reduced, is equal to the ratio of the length of the sloped surface to the height it spans. Owing to conservation of energy, the same amount of mechanical energy (work) is required to lift a given object by a given vertical distance, disregarding losses from friction, but the inclined plane allows the same work to be done with a smaller force exerted over a greater distance.
The angle of friction, also sometimes called the angle of repose, is the maximum angle at which a load can rest motionless on an inclined plane due to friction without sliding down. This angle is equal to the arctangent of the coefficient of static friction μs between the surfaces.
Two other simple machines are often considered to be derived from the inclined plane. The wedge can be considered a moving inclined plane or two inclined planes connected at the base. The screw consists of a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.
The term may also refer to a specific implementation; a straight ramp cut into a steep hillside for transporting goods up and down the hill. This may include cars on rails or pulled up by a cable system; a funicular or cable railway, such as the Johnstown Inclined Plane.

The tension in the cables can be calculated using the weight of the chandelier and the angle the cables make with the horizontal.

2. **Calculate the weight of the chandelier**: The mass of the chandelier is given as 2900 kg. We can calculate the weight using the formula:

\[ \text{Weight} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration due to gravity} \]

Given:
- Mass of the African elephant = 6000 kg
- Acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 m/s² (standard value on Earth)

We will use the Calculator tool to perform this calculation.

### Plan
1. Calculate the weight of the African elephant in Newtons using the formula \( \text{Weight} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration due to gravity} \).

### Evidence
#E1 = Calculator[6000 * 9.81]

### Plan
2. Retrieve the result from the Calculator to determine the weight of the African elephant in Newtons.

### Execution
#E1 = Calculator[6000 * 9.81]

The plan involves using a single step with the Calculator tool to compute the weight directly. The result will give us the weight of the African elephant in Newtons. Let's proceed with the calculation.

Cassie has just finished her session on the trampoline during PE. As she prepares to exit the trampoline, her vertical momentum is reduced by a series of three resistive impulses with the bounce mat. Just prior to this series of impulses, her 51.5-kg body is moving downward at 8.50 m/s. On the first impulse, Cassie experiences an average upward force of 235 N for 0.72 seconds. The second impulse of 76 N*s lasts for 0.48 seconds. The last impulse involves an average upward force of 116 N which cases a 92 kg*m/s momentum change. What vertical velocity does Cassie have after these three impulses?
To determine Cassie's vertical velocity after the three impulses, we need to follow a systematic approach. We'll calculate the change in momentum for each impulse and then update her velocity step-by-step.

### Plan:
1. **Calculate the initial momentum of Cassie before the impulses.**
   - Use the mass and initial velocity to find the initial momentum.

A new conveyor system at the local packaging plan will utilize a motor-powered mechanical arm to exert an average force of 940 N to push large crates a distance of 9 meters in 25 seconds. Determine the power output required of such a motor.
Sure, let's solve this problem step-by-step by using the appropriate external tools. Here's the detailed plan:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Calculate the Work Done:**
   - The work done \( W \) by the mechanical arm can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     W = F \times d
     \]
     where \( F \) is the force (940 N) and \( d \) is the distance (9 meters).
   - Use the Calculator tool to compute this.

   **Plan:** Calculate the work done using the formula \( W = F \times d \).
   **#E1:** Calculator[940 * 9]

2. **Calculate the Power Output:**
   - Power \( P \) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     P = \frac{W}{t}
     \]
     where \( W \) is the work done (from #E1) and \( t \) is the time (25 seconds).
   - Use the Calculator tool to compute this.

   **Plan:** Calculate the power output using the formula \( P = \frac{W}{t} \) with \( W \) from #E1.
