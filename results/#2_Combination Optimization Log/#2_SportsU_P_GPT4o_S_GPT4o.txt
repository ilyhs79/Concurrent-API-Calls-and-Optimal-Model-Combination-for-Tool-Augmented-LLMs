위키검색툴 결과 Alexander DeBrincat (born December 18, 1997) is an American professional ice hockey right winger for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, 39th overall, of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. He has previously played for the Blackhawks and the Ottawa Senators.
Born in Farmington Hills, Michigan, DeBrincat spent one year at Harrison High School before transferring to Lake Forest Academy in Illinois. He had planned to play college ice hockey in Massachusetts but signed with the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for the 2014–15 season. There, he set a franchise record with over 50 goals and 100 points in his first season, and he won the Emms Family Award and CHL Rookie of the Year trophies. During the 2016–17 season, DeBrincat became the all-time Otters goal leader and the top scorer of any OHL player born in the United States. He won the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy, Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy, Red Tilson Trophy, and CHL Player of the Year award for his performance. He spent three years with the Otters, becoming the second player in OHL history to score 50 goals and 100 points all three years.
DeBrincat joined the Blackhawks for the 2017–18 season, where he experienced goal streaks and droughts as a rookie, including three hat-tricks. He surpassed his rookie scoring totals in 2018–19 but fell into a slump during the 2019–20 season, particularly when he was not on the power play. DeBrincat's offensive production improved during the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season, during which he maintained a pace of over a point per game. DeBrincat continued this production the following year when he represented the Blackhawks at the NHL All-Star Game and recorded his second 40-goal season.

He spent three years with the Otters, becoming the second player in OHL history to score 50 goals and 100 points all three years.
DeBrincat joined the Blackhawks for the 2017–18 season, where he experienced goal streaks and droughts as a rookie, including three hat-tricks. He surpassed his rookie scoring totals in 2018–19 but fell into a slump during the 2019–20 season, particularly when he was not on the power play. DeBrincat's offensive production improved during the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season, during which he maintained a pace of over a point per game. DeBrincat continued this production the following year when he represented the Blackhawks at the NHL All-Star Game and recorded his second 40-goal season.

위키검색툴 결과 Connor Charles Hellebuyck ( HEL-ə-buk; born May 19, 1993) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender for the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League. He was selected by the Jets in the fifth round, 130th overall, of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. 

위키검색툴 결과 Ervin Frank "Four Sack" Dusak (July 29, 1920 – November 6, 1994) was an American professional baseball outfielder, infielder and pitcher in Major League Baseball over nine seasons spanning 1941 to 1952 for the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Chicago, he threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg).
Dusak signed with the Cardinals' organization in 1938 and got his nickname from a poem a fan wrote after he hit a home run in the minors. He spent the 1941 season among three Cardinal farm clubs: the Class B Mobile Shippers, Class A1 Houston Buffaloes (who won 103 games), and the top-level Rochester Red Wings, batting a composite .318 with 23 long balls. He earned cups of coffee in the majors with the Cards in 1941 and 1942, and missed the 1943 to 1945 seasons while serving in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of World War II.
Dusak then returned to the Cardinals from 1946 to 1951, primarily as an outfielder, playing some games at second base and third base. On July 7, 1946, he hit a game-winning, three-run home run to beat the Brooklyn Dodgers and to move his club within a half game of the National League lead. Brooklyn and St. Louis would finish the 1946 regular-season in a dead heat, forcing a tie-breaker series that delivered the Cardinals' ninth pennant since 1926. Dusak played a key role in the clinching second game of the series, hitting a triple and an RBI single to help propel the Redbirds to the 8–4 triumph. They went on to win the World Series, with Dusak appearing in four Fall Classic games, getting four at bats, and hitting a double in Game 2.
Dusak saw his most big league action in 1947, hitting .284 in 111 games. When his batting average dropped, he turned to pitching, appearing in 23 games, all in relief, but ended his career primarily as a position player with the Pittsburgh Pirates.  In 413 MLB games played over all or part of nine major-league seasons, Dusak batted .243; his 251 hits included 32 doubles, six triples and 24 homers, with 106 RBI. He drew walks well, with a lifetime .334 on-base percentage that was 91 points higher than his batting average. On the mound, he posted an 0–3 won–lost record and 5.33 earned run average; in 54 innings pitched, he allowed 51 hits and 44 walks, with 26 strikeouts.
After retiring in 1952, Dusak was an insurance agent for 21 years and worked in a bowling alley for a decade. He died in Glendale Heights, Illinois, aged 74.

Prescott ranks fourth all-time in completion percentage with at least 1,500 pass attempts, and is fifth in the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating.
Intended to serve as a backup in his rookie season, Prescott became the Cowboys' starting quarterback after starter Tony Romo was injured in the preseason. He went on to lead the Cowboys to the top seed of the National Football Conference (NFC) and set several rookie quarterback records, earning him Offensive Rookie of the Year. Prescott has since led the Cowboys to three additional division titles and made three Pro Bowl appearances. In 2022, he won the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award.

위키검색툴 결과 Philip Michael Rivers (born December 8, 1981) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons, primarily with the Chargers franchise. He played college football for the NC State Wolfpack and was selected fourth overall in the 2004 NFL draft by the New York Giants, who traded him to the San Diego Chargers during the draft. Rivers was a member of the Chargers for 16 seasons and played his final season for the Indianapolis Colts. Since 2021, he has served as the head football coach at St. Michael Catholic High School.
After spending his first two seasons as a backup, Rivers served as the Chargers' starting quarterback from 2006 to 2019. During his tenure, he was named to eight Pro Bowls while leading the team to six postseason appearances and four division titles. Rivers also helped the franchise win their first playoff game since 1994 and reach the AFC Championship Game in the 2007 season. With the Colts in 2020, he reached the playoffs a seventh time. He was less successful in the postseason and never made a Super Bowl appearance.
Rivers retired fifth all-time in passing yards and touchdowns, both of which are the highest-ranking among quarterbacks without Super Bowl appearances. He is also second all-time in consecutive regular season starts by a quarterback, having started every regular season game between 2006 and 2020. Rivers is considered among the greatest quarterbacks to have never played in a Super Bowl.

위키검색툴 결과 Adriel Jeremiah Green (born July 31, 1988) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for twelve seasons, primarily with the Cincinnati Bengals. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, earning first-team All-American honors. Green was selected by the Bengals with the fourth overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft, where he spent 10 seasons prior to joining the Arizona Cardinals for two years. In 2023, Green signed a one-day deal with the Bengals, and officially retired as a member of the Cincinnati organization.
In his first season with the Bengals, Green made the 2012 Pro Bowl becoming the first rookie receiver to make a Pro Bowl appearance in eight years, and went on to accumulate a total of seven Pro Bowl appearances throughout his career. From 2011 to 2013, Green caught more passes (260) than any other player in NFL history during their first three seasons, a record that was later broken by Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. (288). He had six seasons with 1,000 or more receiving yards.
Green signed with the Cardinals in 2021, having finished his Bengals career ranked second in franchise history, behind only Chad Johnson, in receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and receptions.

위키검색툴 결과 Karl-Anthony Towns Jr. (born November 15, 1995), also known by the initialed nickname KAT, is a Dominican-American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats. Towns was named to the Dominican Republic national team as a 16-year-old. He was selected with the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and went on to be named NBA Rookie of the Year for the 2015–16 season. He has received four All-Star selections, and won the 2021–22 NBA Three-Point Contest. 

위키검색툴 결과 A corner kick, commonly known as a corner, is the method of restarting play in a game of association football when the ball goes out of play over the goal line, without a goal being scored and having last been touched by a member of the defending team. The kick is taken from the corner of the field of play nearest to the place where the ball crossed the goal line.
Corners are considered to be a reasonable goal-scoring opportunity for the attacking side, though not as much as a penalty kick or a direct free kick near the edge of the penalty area.
A corner kick that scores without being touched by another player is called an Olympico goal, or less commonly, Olympic goal.

위키검색툴 결과  

위키검색툴 결과 In association football, one-touch football is passing or shooting the ball with one touch rather than trapping or dribbling the ball first. Often an effective tactic for quick shots from passes or crosses, "flick" passes or for "give and go" passes. One or two touch scrimmages or drills are also used to improve teamwork and passing skills.
This skill is most commonly executed by teams with skillful midfielders and a cohesive frontline. The attackers usually act like target men bringing in other players by simple but elegant 'flicks' or just slight and accurate touches. This style of football, when executed effectively, creates many decoys for opposing defenders, and also creates space for the attacking midfielders to try long-range efforts. It has been observed to be most effective when used in counterattacks by teams with quick and visionary attackers.
One-touch football is exhibited by clubs such as Barcelona, Chelsea, Arsenal, and international teams such as Brazil, Spain, Argentina, and the Netherlands team of the 1970s.

위키검색툴 결과 Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Armenian: Հենրիխ Մխիթարյան, [hɛnˈɾiχ məχitʰɑˈɾjɑn] ; born 21 January 1989) is an Armenian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Serie A club Inter Milan.
Mkhitaryan won four Armenian Premier League titles with Pyunik, and joined Metalurh Donetsk in 2009; he moved to city rivals Shakhtar Donetsk in 2010 for €6.1 million. At Shakhtar, Mkhitaryan set the league goalscoring record in the 2012–13 season, and was named the league's Footballer of the Year. After also winning three domestic doubles, he signed for Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund for a club-record fee of €27.5 million, making him the most expensive Armenian player of all time.
There, he won a DFL-Supercup in 2014, and in the following campaign, registered the most assists in the Bundesliga, with 15, the second most in Europe. He then joined Manchester United for £30 million (€34.3 million), becoming the first Armenian to play in the Premier League. He won the FA Community Shield, and scored the winner to win the UEFA Europa League title. Mkhitaryan was then signed by Arsène Wenger for Arsenal in a swap-deal including Alexis Sánchez in 2018, and then to Serie A club Roma on an initial loan, where he signed permanently in 2020 before joining Internazionale in 2022.
Mkhitaryan was a member of the senior side in his native country from 2007 until his international retirement in 2022. He is Armenia's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 32 goals in 95 matches, as well as registering their first hat-trick. He has been named Armenian Footballer of the Year eleven times, including seven years consecutively from 2011 to 2017. Mkhitaryan was also voted the CIS Footballer of the Year in 2012 and 2013, making him the first Armenian footballer to be named the best player from the post-Soviet countries. 

위키검색툴 결과 A down is a period in which a play transpires in gridiron football. The down is a distinguishing characteristic of the game compared to other codes of football but is synonymous with the 6 "tackle" rule in rugby league. The team in possession of the football has a limited number of downs (four in American football, three in Canadian football) to advance ten yards or more towards their opponent's goal line. If they fail to advance that far, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team. In most situations if a team reaches their final down, they will punt to their opponent, which forces their opponent to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in range, they might instead attempt to score a field goal.

Evidence:
Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Armenian: Հենրիխ Մխիթարյան, [hɛnˈɾiχ məχitʰɑˈɾjɑn] ; born 21 January 1989) is an Armenian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Serie A club Inter Milan.

Plan: Search for information about what "converting the first down" means, specifically in sports terminology.
Evidence:
A down is a period in which a play transpires in gridiron football. The down is a distinguishing characteristic of the game compared to other codes of football but is synonymous with the 6 "tackle" rule in rugby league. The team in possession of the football has a limited number of downs (four in American football, three in Canadian football) to advance ten yards or more towards their opponent's goal line. If they fail to advance that far, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team. In most situations if a team reaches their final down, they will punt to their opponent, which forces their opponent to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in range, they might instead attempt to score a field goal.

위키검색툴 결과 Diego Martín Forlán Corazo (born 19 May 1979) is a Uruguayan professional football manager and former player who played as a striker. Regarded as one of the best forwards of his generation, Forlán is a two-time winner of both the Pichichi Trophy and the European Golden Shoe at club level. With the Uruguay national team, he had notable individual success at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, finishing as joint top scorer with five goals, winning the goal of the tournament, and winning the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player.
Forlán began his career in his native Uruguay as a youth player with Peñarol and Danubio, before joining Argentine club Independiente. After rising through their youth team and after a successful four-year spell, he sealed a move to England with Manchester United in 2002. His form for United was not as successful as at Independiente, although he won the Premier League in 2002–03 and the FA Cup in 2003–04. 
In the summer of 2004, Forlán moved to Spanish side Villarreal. In his first season in Spanish football, he won the Pichichi Trophy. After two more successful seasons with Villarreal, Forlán joined Atlético Madrid, where he once again became the league's top scorer, and became the first player to win the Pichichi Trophy twice since Ronaldo in 1996–97 and 2003–04. Forlán scored in Atlético's 2010 Europa League final victory against Fulham. In 2011, he joined Inter Milan of Italy before moving to Internacional in 2012. After spells in Japan with Cerezo Osaka, back in Uruguay with his boyhood club Peñarol, in India with Mumbai City and in Hong Kong with Kitchee, Forlán retired from professional football in August 2019.
Forlán also had a successful international career, scoring 36 times for his country between his debut in 2002 and his retirement in 2015, including six goals at FIFA World Cups. On 12 July 2011, at the 2011 Copa América in Argentina, which Uruguay won, Forlán earned his 79th international cap in a match against Mexico, breaking the record held since 1986 by goalkeeper Rodolfo Rodríguez. On 20 June 2013, in a match against Nigeria at the 2013 Confederations Cup, Forlán became the first Uruguayan to win 100 caps. Forlán was Uruguay's all-time leading top scorer from 2011 until Luis Suárez overtook him two years later.
